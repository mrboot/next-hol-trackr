# NEXT-HOL-TRACKR

### Another go at creating an app to track holidays booked and accrued

Using:

- React via Next.js with a custom Express server to expose the database
- diskDB to store the data
- Ant-Design as a GUI framework
- isometeric-unfetch to get the data exposed in the database

Learning as I go so expect mistakes and _\*cough\*_ not industry standard coding standards I would imagine!

## TODO:

- [x] ~~account for weekends and bank holidays when calculating time~~
- [x] ~~auto-fill time for entitlement~~
